# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it is important to incorperate scalable and 
changeable coding in order to allow the user to continually update and change the program. When considering the work from 
module one, the advantages of being able to utulize the adaptable coding is that the data is easier to update and read 
compared to other types of data reading. CRUD could be used in the future by allowing for any type of data entry/analysis 
to be more easily applied which can make reading data far more simple.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching problems within Computer Science,it is important to consider the future as the way and how data changes is 
very frequent and rapidly changing. Being able to create a program that is both scalable and adaptable ensures that the 
product would likely see more success in the future. The approach of this project compared to other courses is that I had 
dealt with a very broad database rather than a set piece of data, so being able to incorperate functions to not mistakenly 
add thing I did not want and being able to make it so the data is able to cover the whole data set was crucial. I think 
utilizing things like CRUD will be essential in the future as being able to create an adaptable environment seems like a 
very important topic to me and makes making updates far easier.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists do a variety of things which essentially deal with all technology. In this course, the main idea was to 
make iterating through a data set far easier so the search and rescue company would be able to more easily find dogs that 
can help with their goal. Otherwise, looking through all the shelter would take an extreme amount of time. Being able to 
help companies save time and effort, making their goals easier to achieve which highlights the usefulness of CS.
